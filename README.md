# A guide for Pocket Operators

A guide for the Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator series.  Or at least,
a guide for the PO-24 Office, which is the only one I've got.  The focus
is on which functions work in which mode, as much as anything else.

Designed to be printed on A5, and folded. If you want to fold
the A5 paper into four columns then it's best to print the
PDF with borderless printing.
